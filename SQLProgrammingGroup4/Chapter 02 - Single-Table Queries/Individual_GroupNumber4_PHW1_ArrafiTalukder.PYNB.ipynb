Subsequently, the HAVING clause filters the grouped results to include only orders with a total value greater than $10,000.

Initially, the query selects the Employee ID (EmployeeId) and the last name (EmployeeLastName) of each employee. To filter out employees with last names starting with a lowercase letter, the query utilizes the WHERE clause along with the LEFT and ASCII functions. The LEFT(EmployeeLastName, 1) function extracts the first character (letter) from the EmployeeLastName column of each row, while the ASCII(..) function returns the ASCII value of any character passed through it. The expression ASCII(LEFT(EmployeeLastName, 1)) BETWEEN 97 AND 122 checks if the ASCII value of the first letter of the employee's last name falls within the range of lowercase letters from 'a' (ASCII value 97) to 'z' (ASCII value 122). This effectively filters and returns only those employees whose last names start with a lowercase letter.\n",

Furthermore, the query incorporates Ordering Within Partitions. Here, the row number is influenced by the specified order of columns, namely 'OrderDate' and 'OrderId'. Within each 'CustomerId' group, rows are organized based on the 'OrderDate' and 'OrderId', defined using the 'OVER' clause. Lastly, the query makes use of Window Function Usage.
