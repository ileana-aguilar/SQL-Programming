                "OPERATOR DIFFERENCE: The UNION and UNION ALL operators both combine the result sets of different select statements and return a single result set. However, the UNION ALL operator returns all the rows displayed in the combined result sets into a single result whereas the UNION operator returns only the distinct rows which means no duplicates. \n",
                "\n",
                "OPERATOR EQUIVALENCE: For both outputs to act equivalently, a query case would have to be that the combined result sets of the select statements derived from the tables have no duplicate rows. For example, let age be selected from the customer table (first select statement) and age be selected from the employee table (second select statement). The combined result sets of both select statements have to be all distinct ages for a UNION ALL and UNION operator to be equivalent given they are implemented to return a single result set of only distinct ages. \n",
                "\n",
                "THE BETTER OPERATOR WITH THE CONDITION OF RETURNING SAME OUTPUT: If implementing both the operators within a query return the same results, then, using an UNION ALL operator would be more efficient than an UNION operator due to faster query execution in performance. This is because the UNION operator has to check for duplicate rows within the combined result sets to create the single result set of distinct rows when the UNION ALL operator does not check. \n",
